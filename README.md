# Jukebox Card for Home-Assistant

This is a media player UI for Home-Assistant leveraging the potential of the excellent new
[Lovelace UI.](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/)

It allows you to configure a set of web radio stations (or possibly other radio media IDs such as spotify), and
play them to media player entities of your choice, like chromecast or spotify connect listeners.

You can send different media to different players, which makes it usable for multi-room setups: Let your kids listen
to some *Frozen*, while you're Jazzing in the Kitchen. Volume-Level is handled separately, too.
